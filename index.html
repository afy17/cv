          <p>I am a homeschooled student, currently learning Python in the hope of becoming a Python Developer. I managed to achieve grades 7-9 in all of my GCSEs as a homeschooler, which gave me a much needed confidence boost in my self-teaching methods and inspired me to teach myself even more skills. I was introduced to Python and that's where my love for coding began! I am currently in the process of completeing an online Python coding course, whilst also using a variety of other online resources (such as coding blogs and Youtube videos). I love to build useful projects, which I can use in everyday life (such as a <strong>"Random Dinner Idea"</strong> generator that prints out a random dish with its recipe, very helpful on days when I have absolutely no idea what to cook). My other interests include: baking, badminton, watercolour painting and gaming (my personal favourite game series is <strong>"The Legend of Zelda"</strong>).</p></td>
